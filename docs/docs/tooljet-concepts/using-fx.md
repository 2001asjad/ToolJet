title: Using the FX Functionality
---

Clicking on the **fx** symbol in ToolJet opens up a code editor that allows you to write custom JavaScript expressions. You can find **fx** in the configuration panel on the right, next to various properties and settings of a component.

With **fx**, you can manipulate data, perform calculations, or set conditional logic without leaving the ToolJet interface. It's an invaluable tool for adding complexity and interactivity to your applications.

## Toggle Button 

When using **fx** buttons associated with toggle buttons, the expected output of the code you enter should be a boolean value - true or false. 

For other cases, the expected value is a string. For example, Ii you are setting `Text color`, `Background Color`, `Loader Color`, etc. You need to pass in a JavaScript code that returns a hex code as a string.  

## Access all Variables, Queries, and Components

The expressions you write in the code editor can access all the variables, queries, and components within your application. This allows you to create intricate relationships between different parts of your app, making it more responsive and user-friendly.
