Custom Styles in ToolJet offer a powerful way for users to personalize their app's appearance. This feature allows the implementation of unique theming by injecting custom CSS, overriding the default styling. It's designed to make the visual customization of apps straightforward and efficient.

## Efficient Theming and Consistency
The Custom Styles feature is instrumental in maintaining consistent themes across ToolJet applications. It removes the need to individually style components for each new app, thereby saving time and effort. By applying standardized styles, it ensures that all apps adhere to a unified theme, enhancing the overall development process's efficiency and preserving visual coherence across applications.

## Streamlining Customization with Custom CSS
To add Custom Styles, users can navigate to the Custom Styles Page under Workspace Settings in the ToolJet dashboard. For instance, changing the default color of a button involves identifying the component's class and applying the desired CSS changes on the Custom Styles page. This approach ensures that all instances of the app reflect the new styling, like changing button colors, without the need to edit each button individually. This level of customization ensures a seamless user experience and consistent theming across the workspace.
