Queries allows you to interact with various data sources, such as databases, APIs, and third-party services. They act as the bridge between your application's components and the data you wish to display, manipulate, or store.

These queries are constructed in the Query Panel in the App-Builder, a dedicated section within the ToolJet App-Builder, where you can write low-code or custom SQL statements, API requests, or other data retrieval methods.

## Flexible and Easy To Use
The power of queries in ToolJet lies in their flexibility and ease of use. You can configure queries to run automatically when an application loads, or trigger them based on specific events or user actions. For example, you could set up a query to run when a user clicks a button, fills out a form, or selects an item from a dropdown menu. This enables you to create dynamic, interactive applications that respond to user input in real-time. Additionally, queries can be named and saved for reuse, making it easier to manage complex data operations and maintain your application.


## Integration of Queries and Components
Queries are also deeply integrated with ToolJet's components. Once a query fetches data, you can easily bind that data to various components in your application using ToolJet's templating syntax. This is usually done by enclosing the query name in double curly braces, allowing the data to populate tables, lists, charts, or any other data-driven components. This seamless integration between queries and components is what makes ToolJet a powerful tool for building custom internal applications quickly and efficiently.
