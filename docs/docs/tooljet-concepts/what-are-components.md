title: What Are Components?

<div style={{marginLeft: "40px", marginRight: "40px"}}>

Components in ToolJet serve as the building blocks for creating applications. They are pre-designed elements that you can drag and drop onto the canvas in the App-Builder. ToolJet comes with 45+ built-in components.

</div>

These components range from basic UI elements like buttons, text fields, and tables, to more complex widgets like tables, kanban, charts and maps. By using components, you can quickly assemble a functional and visually appealing application without having to write code from scratch.


## Customizing Components

Components are highly customizable and interactive. Once you place a component on the canvas, you can easily modify its properties, styles, and behaviors through the configuration panel on the right side of the App-Builder. This allows you to make your application dynamic and responsive. For example, you can configure a button to run a specific query when clicked, or set up a table to display the results of a database query.

</div>

## Using Components With Data

In ToolJet, components can be easily connected to various data sources like databases, APIs, and third-party services. This is done through the Query Panel, where you can write custom queries or use create queries with low-code to fetch, update, or manipulate data. Once the data is fetched, you can bind it to components.
